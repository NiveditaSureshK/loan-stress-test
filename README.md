# Unsecured & Small-Business Loan Stress Test

## Goal
Simulate **1 000 macro-economic scenarios**, forecast credit losses on SME loans *and* credit-card receivables, and estimate **worst-case CET1 erosion** over 12 quarters.

## Why It Matters
Annual **CCAR/DFAST** filings require banks to prove capital resilience. Automating this analysis shortens prep cycles and surfaces capital pressure points in near real time.

## Key Deliverables
1. **Monte-Carlo scenario generator** (GDP ‚àÜ, unemployment).  
2. **Panel PD & LGD models** for SMEs; **LightGBM PD model** for cards.  
3. **Tableau waterfall dashboard** + one-page PDF summary generated via Papermill.

## Success Metric

The performance of this stress-testing engine is evaluated using the **worst-case CET1 depletion**, defined as:

```python
worst_case_cet1 = min(CET1_q) - CET1_start
```

**Where:**

- `CET1_start`: The Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio at the beginning of the stress test  
- `CET1_q`: A list or array of projected CET1 values over time across multiple Monte Carlo scenarios  
- `min(CET1_q)`: Represents the worst-case CET1 outcome under simulated macroeconomic shocks  

A **more negative value** of `worst_case_cet1` signals a greater drop in regulatory capital, indicating **higher portfolio risk** under stress. The model helps identify weak spots in SME and credit card portfolios and supports CET1 buffer planning.

## Quick Start

Follow the steps below to set up the environment and install the package locally:

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate stress
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Install the package in editable mode

```bash
# Install the package locally for development
python -m pip install -e .
```
